							<p class="lead"> Staying focused when you are at home can sometimes be tricky. There is often lots of distraction, for example, housemates, tv and music, which can take your time off task and make studying much harder than it needs to be. An easy solution to this is to find a space away from home that is free from disturbances. Some options could be:

							<p class="lead"> A study plan is an effective way to help you manage your time whilst at university. A study plan is an organized schedule that outlines study times, upcoming deadlines and learning goals. Remember, each student studies differently and so everyoneâ€™s schedule will look different.  Create a study plan that is reasonable- blocking off four hours with no break will not lead to high quality work.

							<p class="lead">
							A good way to consolidate your knowledge on your topic is so teach it to a friend or a housemate from a different course. This will help you simplify difficult and abstract concepts into more manageable chunks.  They might ask questions you had not thought or challenge your way of thinking, which could help with your critical thinking and writing in the end! </p>

							<p class="lead"> It can be tempting when all those deadlines are approaching to spend all of your time studying but taking a break away from the library is important. Playing sport and getting involved with societies can help you relax and take your mind off academic tasks. When you return to work, you will feel refreshed, have a clearer perspective, and feel ready to continue.

							<p class="lead"> It is not possible to revise every single paper that you have read so focus on the most important topics. Choose the one you like or find most interesting and dedicate your time to them. Doing this will increase your confidence and help you feel more prepared for the exams.

							<p class="lead"> One of the most effective ways to prepare for exams is to practice taking past versions. This helps you become familiar with the format of questions, and-if you time yourself-  it can be good practice for making sure you spend the right amount of time on each section.

							<p class="lead"> It is important to keep hydrated to maintain focus and keep those headaches away! Limit the amount of caffeine you are drinking as this can disrupt your sleep, make you groggy and can become quite an expensive habit!
